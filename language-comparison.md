# Introduction

The course [Numerical tecniques for photorealistic image
generation](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2021/numerical-tecniques-photorealistic-image-generation)
(prof. Maurizio Tomasi) aims to teach students how to develop complex
computer codes to model the phenomenon of light propagation. The
student will learn how large programs are structured, which are the
best techniques to organize the code, and how does one ensure quality
and reproducibility of the results.

As the course does not mandate the use of any official programming,
students might feel uneasy at picking one language out of the many
available: not only there are several well-known languages whose usage
is well-established in universities and industries (e.g., C, C++,
Fortran, Java, …), but a plethora of new languages are being created
every year: Rust, Julia, Nim, Crystal, etc.

In this document I show the peculiarities of a few languages that are
suitable for the course. I will start with C++, which is probably well
known by the majority of the students, and then I will move to other
languages. You are advised to read the section about C++ *even if you
do not plan to use this language*, as I will often refer to it when
describing other languages.

All the languages are presented following this schema:

-   A short description of the language;

-   A code example, showing how to implement the following features:

    -   A «vector» data structure that implements addition, scalar
        product and scalar-vector product. This example is relevant
        for the course, as we will make heavy use of 3D geometry.

    -   A function to print a vector (or at least to convert it into a
        string of characters) in human-readable form (e.g.,
        `<1.0, 3.0, 2.0>`). This kind of function is handy to have
        when debugging vector-related algorithms, and its
        implementation shows how the language deals with strings.

    -   A «ray» data structure that implements the geometric concept
        of a *directed line*, i.e., a line starting from some point
        $P$ and running along some direction $\vec d$.

    -   A «sphere» data structure that describes a 3D sphere placed at
        some position with a given radius.

    -   An algorithm that tests whether a ray intersects a sphere, and
        at which point in 3D space. Ray intersection tests will be
        widely used during the course.

-   Finally, for each language I will list its most notable advantages
    and shortcomings.

The purpose of this document is to provide students with a general
idea of some languages, but it is surely not meant to be exhaustive!
Other languages that are not covered here might still be well suited
for the course (e.g., [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/),
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)):
contact the teacher if you are interested in any of those.


# How to learn a new programming language

The opinion of the teacher is that a student willing to learn a new
language should follow these steps:

1.  Find and read a good book, or blog posts, or YouTube video that
    show the basics of the language. Try to follow the exercises and
    type them *on your own* instead of using cut-and-paste.

2.  Watch a few YouTube videos that show how to actually *use* the
    language beyond the syntax. This is a valuable way of learning how
    to use editors and IDEs effectively, as these abilities are
    difficult to grasp while reading a book. The difference with the
    videos mentioned in Point 1 above is that here you should
    understand how the language works **in a development
    environment**. For instance, [A Gentle Introduction to
    Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4igzy3bGVkQ) is a great way
    to learn Julia's syntax, but videos like [Getting Started with
    Julia (for Experienced
    Programmers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lJK92bEKow) are
    more effective at this stage, because the presenter shows how to
    set up Visual Studio Code and use plugins to develop in Julia more
    efficiently. (Please do **not** assume that Vim or Gedit are «all
    you need» for this course: this is a mistake that students have
    done in the past!)

3.  Go to the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/) and
    use your newly-learned skills to implement solutions for the first
    5−10 problems. The problems in Project Euler are increasingly
    complicated, but in a *mathematical* sense: you usually do not
    need anything else other than `int`/`float` variables and a few
    statements (`if`, `while`, `for`) to solve them. (But as you
    progress through the problems, they quickly become *mathematically
    hard* to solve, so please do not go beyond the first 10–20
    problems.)

4.  Once you have successfully solved a few problems in Project Euler,
    try to solve a few problems from the past editions of [Advent of
    code](https://adventofcode.com/). These programs require more
    skills than Project Euler's, as they are focused on *coding*
    rather than on *mathematics*. As Project Euler's problems, these
    are listed in increasing order of difficulty. It is not needed
    that you do the exercises for this year, as the site keeps the
    archives of the past editions (e.g.,
    [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020),
    [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), etc.).


# C++

There should be no need to present the C++ language. It is a widely
used language, and it is ok for the kind of tasks required in the
course. It was developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup, which
adopted Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) atop the C language. In the
following years, C++ has progressively abandoned the OOP-centric
approach and has adopted other programming styles as well; today is
really a «multi-paradigm language».

To implement a «vector» data structure, one can use a `struct`:

```c++
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

struct Vec {
    double x, y, z;
    constexpr Vec(double ax = 0.0, double ay = 0.0, double az = 0.0)
        : x{ax}, y{ay}, z{az} {}

    std::string format() const {
        std::stringstream sstr;
        sstr << "<" << x << ", " << y << ", " << z << "\n";
        return sstr.str();
    }
};

[[nodiscard]] constexpr Vec operator*(double t, const Vec & v) noexcept {
    return Vec{t * v.x, t * v.y, t * v.z};
}

[[nodiscard]] constexpr double operator*(const Vec &v, const Vec & w) noexcept {
    return v.x * w.x + v.y * w.y + v.z * w.z;
}
```

As stated in the introduction, the purpose of the code examples shown
in this document is to illustrate how to implement custom operators
for the `Vec` class, namely sum, dot product, and scalar-vector
product. Printing a `Vec` object is implemented through the
`Vec::format` method, which uses a `std::stringstream` object; this is
the standard approach in C++17, although students developing their
programs for the course can rely on more advanced libraries[^fmt] to
format strings.

[^fmt]: A good choice is [`fmt`](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html),
    which is going to be included in the next C++ standard (C++20).

The code above makes use of a few features of C++17, like the
`[[nodiscard]]` and `constexpr` specifiers. Students willing to use
C++ in this course should become accustomed with the most recent
releases of the C++ standard.

The following code implements the `Ray` and `Sphere` data structures;
the latter has the method `intersect`, which checks if a ray (oriented
line) and a sphere intersect. It is not fundamental to understand the
mathematics used here; it is enough to note that the code makes use of
overloaded operators on the `Vec` class, like the ones I defined above
(sum, dot product, scalar-vector product).

```c++
struct Ray {
  Vec m_o, m_d;
  double m_tmin, m_tmax;

  Ray(const Vec &origin, const Vec &dir)
      : m_o{origin}, m_d{dir}, m_tmin{DEFAULT_TMIN}, m_tmax{DEFAULT_TMAX} {}
};

struct Sphere {
  double m_r;
  Vec m_p;

  constexpr Sphere(double r, Vec p) : m_r{r}, m_p{p} {}

  [[nodiscard]] constexpr bool intersect(Ray &ray) const noexcept {
    const Vec op{m_p - ray.m_o};     // Vector difference
    const double dop{ray.m_d * op};  // Dot product
    const double D{dop * dop - op * op + m_r * m_r};

    if (0.0 > D) {
      return false;
    }

    const double sqrtD{sqrt(D)};

    const double tmin{dop - sqrtD};
    if (ray.m_tmin < tmin && tmin < ray.m_tmax) {
      return true;
    }

    const double tmax{dop + sqrtD};
    return ray.m_tmin < tmax && tmax < ray.m_tmax;
  }
};
```

Apart from the mathematical details, everything in the code above
should look familiar to anybody who has written C++ programs in the
past.

Let's now list a few advantages of C++:

-   Almost every student should have already learnt the language in
    their freshman's years;
-   The commonly used C++ compilers (GCC, Clang) produce very fast
    executables;
-   There are some very good IDEs that ease code writing; a
    particularly good one is CLion
    ([www.jetbrains.com/clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/));
    other good choices are Qt Creator
    ([www.qt.io/product/development-tools](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools))
    and Visual Studio Code
    ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/));
-   There are plenty of resources around to use when one is stuck. You
    are advised to bookmark the site
    [www.cplusplus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com/), which contains
    the documentation of the whole C++ standard library as well as
    several examples.

However, the language has its warts:

-   No standard way to download and install external libraries, as
    many students who have tried to install ROOT on their own
    computers already know. (Unlike other languages like Rust, C\#,
    Julia, Nim, there is no standard package manager for C++.) In the
    past, this has proven to be the biggest pain points for students
    who picked C++.

-   No standard unit testing library. As we will rely heavily on unit
    tests, this point is particularly relevant for the course.

-   No standard way to compile and deploy applications.

-   It can be extremely complex. Consider these examples:


    -   The way one has to declare classes in header files and
        implement functions in `.cpp` files is error-prone, because of
        the way dependencies must be specified[^dependencies] in
        `Makefile`. Students picking C++ are expected to use advanced
        build systems like CMake ([cmake.org](https://cmake.org/)).

    -   The new uniform initialization using `{}` introduced by C++11,
        despite being a significant advantage over the old way to
        initialize stuff, can be confusing. Consider this example:

        ```c++
        std::vector<int> v1(4, 3);  // Result: 3, 3, 3, 3
        std::vector<int> v2{4, 3};  // Result: 4, 3
        ```

    -   The rule to use `;` is inconsistent, as it is mandatory to use
        a `;` after a class but not after having defined a
        function/method:

        ```c++
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }   // No `;` is required here…

        struct Vec {
            double x, y, z;
        };  // …but here it is!
        ```

    -   The syntax to invoke a constructor with no parameters for a
        class look weird, as you must avoid appending `()`, unlike you
        do when calling a function with no parameters:

        ```c++
        std::cout << rand();  // Ok, call rand without arguments

        // Error: this does *not* mean that the default constructor
        // (without arguments) must be called
        MyClass obj();
        ```

    -   The standard library makes a heavy use of templates, which
        often make error messages complex.

    -   It inherits the way C deals with pointers, which enables to
        write really weird code:

        ```c++
        #include <iostream>

        int main() {
          int a[3] = {3, 2, 5};

          // Surprise! This compiles and prints "5". Guess why?
          std::cout << 2[a] << "\n";
        }
        ```

[^dependencies]: For example, if one changes an header file but fails
        to list the proper dependencies in the `Makefile`, some `.cpp`
        files depending on that header might fail to be recompiled in
        a `.o` file, leading to potential disasters.

Past experience has shown that people that picked C++ because they
felt the course would have been «easier» to follow have had to tackle
several problems that were non-existent in other languages. If you
want to pick an easy language to use, you should avoid C++ and choose
something else; good choices are C\#, Nim, or Crystal.

On the other hand, people that already had a strong interest in C++
were satisfied to have used it, as they felt they significantly
improved their coding skills.


# Nim

Nim ([nim-lang.org](https://nim-lang.org/)) is not as widespread and
used as C\#, Kotlin, etc. However, it is extremely well designed and
performant. It was created by Andreas Rumpf in 2008, and it is deeply
inspired by the Pascal language. (In fact, the very first Nim compiler
was written in [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org/).)

Nim is the language I used to prepare both the HTML version of the
course slides and the course notes. I picked it because it can either
produce a standalone executable or a Javascript code to be loaded in
HTML pages. This means that Nim programs can be run either from the
terminal or within a web browser; this is a feature that only a few
languages offer. (See below for an example.)

Nim's syntax looks like a mixture of Python and Pascal, as the
following implementation of the `Vec` data type shows:

```nim
type
    Vec = object
        x*, y*, z* : float64

# The $ procedure translates any value to a string
func `$`*(v : Vec) : string =
    result = "<" & $(v.x) & ", " & $(v.y) & ", " & $(v.z) & ">"

func `*`*(a, b : Vec) : float64 =
    result = a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z

func `*`*(t : float64; v : Vec) : Vec =
    result.x = t * v.x
    result.y = t * v.y
    result.z = t * v.z
```

In Nim, a `object` is like a `struct` in C++. The use of `*` at the
end of functions, variables, and methods indicates that these should
be made *public*, i.e., they should be exported whenever the file is
imported by some script. It is quite like the `public` keyword in C++.

Nim uses the `type` keyword, much like Pascal. However, it avoids
using `{}` or `begin..end` like in C++ or Pascal, because like Python
it uses indentation to delimit the extents of functions.

Note that you can redefine operators like `+` and `*` using the `func`
keyword, instead of using dedicated keywords like `operator` in C++:
only, you must wrap them within backticks (`` ` ``), like in ``func
`$`*``.

Returning values from procedures requires to use the implicit `result`
variable. (This feature is shared with Pascal.)

The following code shows how to implement the `Ray` and `Sphere` data
structures, as well as the ray/sphere intersection:

```nim
import math

type
    Ray = object
        m_o* : Vec
        m_d* : Vec
        m_tmin* : float64
        m_tmax* : float64

    Sphere = object
        m_p* : Vec
        m_r* : float64

func intersect(sphere: Sphere; ray: Ray) : bool =
    let op = sphere.m_p - ray.m_o
    let dop = ray.m_d * op
    let D = dop * dop - op * op + sphere.m_r * sphere.m_r

    if 0 > D:
        return false

    let sqrtD = sqrt(D)
    let tmin = dop - sqrtD
    if (ray.m_tmin < tmin) and (tmin < ray.m_tmax):
        return true

    let tmax = dop - sqrtD
    return (ray.m_tmin < tmax) and (tmax < ray.m_tmax)
```

Nim introduces *three* ways to declare variables:

-   Using `const`, the value of a variable (well, it is indeed a
    «constant» rather than a «variable») must be known at compilation
    time;

-   Using `let`, the value of a variable is assigned once and never
    changed later;

-   Using `var`, a variable can be changed as many times as needed,
    but without changing its type.

The difference between `const` and `let` is subtle; typically the
programmer does not know what the value used in a `let` will be, but
once it is assigned it is not going to be changed. A typical case for
`let` is for some input from the user (e.g., a file name containing
some input data): the programmer cannot tell what is going to be the
name of the file, but surely the variable `file_name` is not going to
be changed once it is assigned. On the other hand, mathematical
constants like $\pi$ are known in advance and should be declared as
`const`. This distinction improves a lot the clarity of the code, as
most of the situations where one declares a variable, they usually
mean to use a `let`, i.e., the variable is assigned but then never
changed.

Nim has several advantages over other languages:

-   No need to write a `Makefile`, just type

    ```
    nim compile --run FILENAME.nim
    ```

    to compile and run `FILENAME.nim`; this triggers the compilation
    of any file used by `FILENAME.nim`. (The command
    `nim compile --run` can be shortened to `nim c -r`.)

-   It has a clean syntax, with no `;` characters;

-   The code runs very fast: in fact, together with FreeBASIC and
    Crystal, it is the only language able to consistently reach C++
    speeds in the codes I have written for this course.

-   Internally, Nim produces a C program that is then compiled by
    `gcc` or `clang`. (A switch forces the Nim compiler to generate a
    C++ program, which can be fed to `g++` or `clang++`.) Thanks to
    this way of compiling executables, it is trivial to use C/C++
    libraries[^root] within a Nim program, using the two pragmas
    `{.importc.}` and `{.importcpp.}`.

-   Similarly to C\#, Rust, Crystal, and Julia, it has a standard
    package manager, `nimble`, which provides the ability to quickly
    create and run empty «Hello world!» projects, as well as
    downloading and installing libraries from the web.

    The following command creates a new Nim program in the directory
    `myproj`:

    ```
    $ nimble init newproj
    ```

    Within the folder `myproj`, the following command compiles and run
    the program:

    ```
    $ nimble run
    ```

-   Being able to convert Nim code to C/C++ code, the Nim compiler can
    produce standalone executables by calling automatically a C/C++
    compiler. But it is able to produce a Javascript program, which
    can be loaded within a HTML page and run in a browser
    ([nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html](https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#backends-the-javascript-target)).

    The following image shows the result of applying a 3D projection
    code to produce a HTML page (left) and a PDF image (right):

    ![](pd-images/nim-html-canvas.png)

    The two images look the same because they have been rendered using
    the same code, yet the two formats enable different applications:

    1. The image on the left is included in a live HTML page, and the
       controls at the bottom enable the user to customize the angle
       of view: changing the numbers triggers a call to the Javascript
       code produced by the Nim compiler out of my Nim source code.
    2. The image on the right is produced by the same Nim code that
       has been compiled to C and then fed to `gcc`. The output
       program invokes Cairo[^cairo], a C library that generates PDF
       files
       ([www.cairographics.org](https://www.cairographics.org/)), and
       it is thus suitable to be included in a LaTeX file.

[^root]: Yes, you can use ROOT in Nim if you want! You just need to
    force the compiler to output C++ code instead of C and use the
    `{.importcpp.}` pragma to create your own bindings.

[^cairo]: Cairo is a C library to create graphics and save it in PNG,
    PDF, or SVG files. Nim bindings can be installed through the
    command `nimble install cairo`.


Disadvantages:

-   Unfortunately Nim does not have a wide user base. As a
    consequence, there are not many online resources to learn the
    language.

-   The quality of the documentation is not as high as for other
    languages (e.g., C\#). This is partly mitigated by the existence
    of three books about Nim: [*Nim in
    action*](https://www.manning.com/books/nim-in-action), by Dominik
    Picheta (Manning, 2017), [*Computer programming with the Nim
    programming language*](http://ssalewski.de/nimprogramming.html), by
    Stefan Salewski, which is an e-book available for free, and
    [*Mastering
    Nim*](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Nim-complete-programming-language/dp/B0B4R7B9YX),
    by Nim's creator, Andreas Rumpf. (However, I have never read the
    latter, so I cannot comment about its quality.)


The opinion of the teacher is that Nim is one of the best language to
use for this course: it is easy to learn, extremely performant, and it
provides all the tools needed to implement the tasks required in the
curse. Moreover, it is extremely elegant and well-designed.


# Crystal

The Crystal language is one of the youngest languages considered in
this document. The history that leads to Crystal is interesting and
worth to be told. Crystal is a reboot of the famous [Ruby
language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), which in turns is a take
over the old [Perl language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl). Perl
is a language created by [Larry
Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall), whose name was
originally «Pearl» (a reference to the [*pearl of great
price*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Pearl) in
Matthew's Gospel) and indicated the aim to produce a useful tool to
administer servers. Perl was used to create the
[autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) tool, which is well
known to any Linux programmer; moreover, it backs up websites like
[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/). However, despite being very
famous, Perl is also known for its lack of readability; consider this
example, taken from a [Perl
tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_special_variables.htm#):

```perl
# Save this in a file "test.pl" and run it using
#
#    perl test.pl

foreach ('hickory','dickory','doc') {
   print;
   print "\n";
}
```

The program is very simple to read and more lightweight than it would
have been in C++ (with its `#include <iostream>`, and `using namespace
std`, and stuff like that). However, the output of the program is a
surprise:

```
hickory
dickory
doc
```

This happens because within the `foreach` loop the hidden variable
`$_` is set to the value of the three elements in the list, and the
`print` command outputs the value of `$_` if nothing else is passed.
Perl is full of hidden parameters and shortcuts that can make source
code very hard to understand.

For this reason, in the mid-1990s a Japanese programmer, Yukihiro
Matsumoto, created
[Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)),
whose name is of course a reference to «pearl», Perl's original name.
Ruby's aim is to be as versatile as Perl but far easier to read. It
achieved huge success in early 2000s and was fundamental for the
spread of modern websites, thanks to its famous web framework [Ruby on
rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which powers sites like
[GitHub](https://github.com/) (we'll use it a lot in this course!) and
[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). Ruby programs read like English and
are easy to understand even by people that are not proficient with the
language. Here is the Perl program shown above translated to Ruby; as
you can see, there are no hidden variables, yet the program is very
simple and free of noise:

```ruby

The problem with Ruby is its slowness, as it is an interpreted
language much like Perl and Python: programs written in Ruby can be
orders of magnitude slower than C++ programs!

In 2014, a team of developers released the [Crystal
language](https://crystal-lang.org/): again, a pun to «pearls» and
«rubies»! The syntax of Crystal programs is very similar to Ruby's,
but its creators added ahead-of-time compilation through the LLVM
framework: this means that programs must be compiled into an
executable before being executed. (It's the same in C and C++, where
you must call `gcc` or `g++` to build an executable, but unlike Perl,
Python, or Ruby.) The usage of LLVM enables Crystal programs to be as
fast as programs written in C++, Julia, or Rust.

Let's show how to define a new type, `Vec`, using Crystal:

```ruby
# A "struct" is like a "class", but it has fewer features and enables
# the compiler to produce more efficient code
struct Vec
  # These would be called member variables; their type is
  # deduced by the constructor `initialize` (see below)
  property x, y, z

  # `Initialize` is the name of the constructor; in C++ you would
  # have written `Vec::Vec`. Note that using `@` in front of the
  # parameters mean that they must be used to initialize the
  # properties with the same name. Here we declare that `x`, `y`,
  # and `z` are 64-bit floating point values.
  def initialize(@x : Float64, @y : Float64, @z : Float64)
  end

  # Operator overloading is very simple to do in Crystal!
  #
  #                   +------+     This means that the result is of
  #                   |      |  <- the same type as the class, `Vec`
  def +(other : self) : self
    # Like in Julia, if it's the last line before a `end`,
    # you can avoid writing `return` explicitly
    Vec.new(@x + other.x, @y + other.y, @z + other.z)
  end

  def -(other : self) : self
    Vec.new(@x - other.x, @y - other.y, @z - other.z)
  end

  # Specifying the return type is not mandatory, the compiler is smart
  # enough to figure it out. If you want to be explicit, you can write
  #
  #     def *(other : self) : Float64
  #
  def *(other : self)
    @x * other.x + @y * other.y + @z * other.z
  end

  # `to_s` means: «convert this type into a string»
  def to_s : String
    "<#@x, #@y, #@z>"  # In strings, writing @variable means:
                       # «put here the value of the variable»
  end
end
```

The weird variable names with `@` refer to *member variables*; in
Python, you would write `self.x` instead of `@x`. As you can see,
operator overloading is extremely easy in Crystal. The method
`initialize` is the constructor; in C++ it would have been named
`Vec::Vec`.

Defining `Ray` and `Sphere` is equally simple:

```ruby
struct Ray
  property m_o, m_d, m_tmin, m_tmax
  
  def initialize(@m_o : Vec, @m_d : Vec, @m_tmin = 1e-10, @m_tmax = 1e+10)
  end
end

class Sphere
  property m_r, m_p
  def initialize(@m_r : Float64, @m_p : Vec)
  end

  def intersect(ray : Ray) : Bool
    op = @m_p - ray.m_o
    dop = ray.m_d * op
    d = dop ** 2 - op * op + @m_r ** 2

    # This kind of "if" syntax makes the code very readable like English!
    # But you can write plain "if" statements like Python and C++, if you want.
    return false if 0 > d

    sqrtd = Math.sqrt(d)
    tmin = dop - sqrtd
    return true if (ray.m_tmin < tmin) && (tmin < ray.m_tmax)

    tmax = dop + sqrtd
    
    ((ray.m_tmin < tmax) && (tmax < ray.m_tmax))
  end
end
```

The performance of the code is extremely good and perfectly comparable
with C++ or Rust.

Here are a few highlights from the language:

-   The `crystal` compiler supports a web-based interactive editor
    that is very handy when you are learning the language. Just start
    `crystal play` and open your web browser to the local address
    [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

-   The most notable feature of Crystal is its heavy inspiration on
    the Ruby syntax: simple scripts can be either interpreted as
    written in Ruby and Crystal. This means that when you look for
    information about how to do something in Crystal, there are
    chances that you might reuse some StackOverflow answer about Ruby,
    which is far more widely used than Crystal. (Of course, Crystal is
    **not** Ruby, and anything but the simplest Ruby scripts won't
    compile as Crystal programs.)

    As an example, consider the following program, which calculates
    the sum of the first 100 000 000 numbers:

    ```ruby
    # Save this in file "test.rb"
    maxnum = 100_000_000
    sum = 0.0

    (1..maxnum).each do |num|
        sum += num
    end

    puts "The sum of the first #{maxnum} numbers is #{sum}"
    ```

    This is valid code in Ruby, but also in Crystal, and you can run it
    using either the `ruby` interpreted or the `crystal` compiler:

    ```
    $ ruby test.rb
    The sum of the first 100000000 numbers is 5.00000005e+15
    
    $ crystal run test.rb
    The sum of the first 100000000 numbers is 5.00000005e+15
    ```
    
    However, the big difference between the two ways of running the
    code is that the former is *interpreted* by Ruby, while the second
    is *compiled* to optimized machine code. In fact, if we compile
    the program using `crystal build --release` and time the
    execution, we can see the huge difference in the time required to
    produce the output:
    
    ```
    $ time ruby test.rb
    The sum of the first 100000000 numbers is 5.00000005e+15

    real    0m7,504s
    user    0m7,436s
    sys     0m0,034s

    $ crystal build --release -o ./test test.rb
    
    $ time ./test
    The sum of the first 100000000 numbers is 5.00000005e+15
    
    real    0m0,105s
    user    0m0,103s
    sys     0m0,000s
    ```
    
    The program compiled by Crystal took just 0.1 s, while the one
    interpreted by Ruby was 75 times slower!
    
-   Crystal is an OOP language, much more object-oriented than C++. In
    C++, you can call class methods using the dot `.`:
    
    ```c++
    int main() {
      std::string s = "Hello";
      
      // Call the method "size" of the object "s"
      std::cout << s.size() << "\n";  // This prints "5"
    }
    ```
    
    In Crystal, a syntax like `s.size()` is extended to *any* value,
    including literals (and you can avoid empty parenthesis):
    
    ```ruby
    # Since "Hello" is an object, you can call the method "size"
    # directly on it
    puts "Hello".size    # This prints "5"
    ```
    
    This characteristic has been mutuated by Ruby, whose design strive
    to achieve the maximum elegance. In fact, instead of having `for`
    loops, Crystal (and Ruby) define the method `each` on container
    objects, i.e., variables that contain collections of objects:
    
    ```ruby
    # The method "each" is called on the list of strings
    ["Strong force", "Weak force"].each do |value|
      puts value
    end
    ```
    
    This way of writing code is used pervasively in Ruby and Crystal,
    and it lets to produce very compact and elegant programs.

-   A nice introduction to the language is available in the [online
    manual](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.5/getting_started/).
    If you prefer to learn Crystal using a textbook, [*Crystal
    Programming*](https://www.packtpub.com/product/crystal-programming/9781801818674),
    by G. Dietrich and G. Bernal (Packt) is a more in-depth
    explanation of the way Crystal works.
    
-   If you pick Crystal consider that it is a young and not widespread
    language; this implies that editor support is not as good as for
    other mainstream languages (C++, C\#, Java, Kotlin…) and that
    you're less likely to find help using Google or
    [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). But you can rely on
    the [Crystal forum](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/) if you need
    help!
    
-   The Crystal compiler comes with
    [Shards](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.5/man/shards/index.html),
    a tool that lets to compile programs and download and install
    libraries automatically. There is no need to use makefiles if you
    use Crystal!
    
    For instance, to create a new application you write
    
    ```sh
    $ crystal init app myapp
    ```
    
    and a new folder `myapp` is populated with a number of files. To
    compile all the files in the `myapp` folder and run the
    executable, you just write
    
    ```sh
    $ cd myapp
    $ shards run
    ```
    
    and all the source files will be compiled to build an executable,
    which is then automatically run without the need to write a
    `Makefile`.

-   Till today, Crystal is not [fully functional on
    Windows](https://crystal-lang.org/install/on_windows/). You can
    check the progress on [this
    page](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/projects/6#card-16297567):
    at the time of writing, it seems that things are converging, but
    full support is not here yet. However, you can probably circumvent
    this limitation if you use the [Windows
    WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The teacher believes that Crystal is a nearly perfect language to be
used for this course. However, like Nim you must be prepared to cope
with the parcity of documentation and the lack of a full IDE.


# C\#

The C\# (pron. «C sharp») language has been developed by a Microsoft
team lead by Anders Hejlsberg; its first release dates back to 2000.
The aim of the team was to implement a «saner» version of the C and
C++ languages, which explains the multiple puns in the name:

-   The sharp sign `#` can be seen as two `++` one atop the other,
    suggesting that C\# is an improvement over C++;
-   In anglophone countries, C\# is the note immediately above C.
-   «Sharp» can be used as a synonym for «cool», «smart», etc.

Unlike C++, C\# adopts a OOP-centered approach. It does not aim to be
100% compatible with C++, which has enabled its designers to get rid
of some of the complexities of the latter.

Under the hood, the way C\# programs are executed differs
significantly from C++, because they are run in a *managed*
environment: the compiler translates the program to a low-level
representation, which is then run by another program, called the
*Common Language Runtime* (CLR). The purpose of the CLR is to
translate the low-level representation into actual machine
instructions that are sent to the CPU. This is in contrast with the
way traditional compilers work: GCC and Clang translate the program
directly to CPU instructions at compilation time.

Although the managed approach might seem slower to execute because of
the on-the-fly translation made by the CLR to actually execute the
code, the CLR implements a number of optimizations that make its
performance similar to C++. In particular, the CLR measures the way
the code is used during the execution and can re-generate CPU
instructions according to what it has learnt[^clrrewrite]. Because of
this, a program running in a managed environment requires some time to
optimize itself (the so-called *burn-in phase*), but then after some
time spent running it can be as performant as C++. In the tests I did
while preparing the material for this course, the C\# compiler was
able to produce programs whose performance was always very close to
C++'s.

[^clrrewrite]: For example, if an `else` branch of an `if` statement
    is executed very often, the CLR can rewrite the `if` statement to
    swap the code below `if` with the code below `else`, as this might
    make the code faster.

Here is an example showing how to implement a basic `Vec` class in
C\#. Note that, despite a few differences, the syntax looks very
similar to C++'s:

```cs
public struct Vec {
    public double x, y, z;

    public Vec(double _x, double _y, double _z) {
        this.x = _x;
        this.y = _y;
        this.z = _z;
    }

    public static implicit operator string (Vec v) {
        return string.Format("<{0}, {1}, {2}>", v.x, v.y, v.z);
    }

    public static Vec operator *(double t, Vec v) {
        return new Vec(t * v.x, t * v.y, t * v.z);
    }

    public static double operator *(Vec a, Vec b) {
        return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z;
    }
}
```

C\# provides a few high-level functionalities with respect to C++. One
of these is first-class string support, which means that converting a
vector into a string can make use of the handy `string.Format` class,
instead of relying on the cumbersome `std::stringstream` class. Note
that, unlike C++, C\# does not force the programmer to remember when
to use `;` after a closing brace `}`.

To access the data members of a class, you must explicitly reference
them using `this`; this is similar to the `self` parameter in the
Python language.

Defining rays and spheres is similar:

```cs
public struct Ray {
    public Vec m_o, m_d;
    public double m_tmin, m_tmax;

    public Ray(Vec _o, Vec _d) {
        this.m_o = _o;
        this.m_d = _d;
        m_tmin = 1e-10;
        m_tmax = 1e10;
    }
}

public struct Sphere {
    public Vec m_p;
    public double m_r;

    public Sphere(Vec _p, double _r) { this.m_p = _p; this.m_r = _r; }

    public bool Intersect(Ray r) {
        Vec op = this.m_p - r.m_o;
        double dop = r.m_d * op;
        double D = dop * dop - op * op + m_r * m_r;

        if (0.0 > D)
            return false;

        double sqrtD = Math.Sqrt(D);
        double tmin = dop - sqrtD;
        if(r.m_tmin < tmin && tmin < r.m_tmax) {
            return true;
        }

        double tmax = dop + sqrtD;
        return r.m_tmin < tmax && tmax < r.m_tmax;
    }
}
```

Here are a few advantages of C\# over C++:

-   It is similar to C++, yet it is considerably easier:

    -   No weird syntax rules dealing with missing `;` and uniform
        initializers;

    -   No pointers;

    -   No multiple inheritance;

    -   Easy, lightweight inheritance through *interfaces*;

    -   No need to call `delete` on objects allocated with `new`, as
        the compiler figures when to call it by itself;

    -   Easy way to implement getters and setters (i.e., the
        `SetA()`/`GetA()` methods that are widely used in OOP C++
        codes) through *properties*.

-   It is extremely easy to develop new projects, as the C\#
    environment can take care of creating a directory structure and
    project, compiling it, running tests, download libraries from
    internet, etc. There is no need to write a `Makefile`!

    For instance, to create a new program in the directory `myprog`,
    after you have installed .NET5, you just type the following:

    ```
    $ dotnet new console -o myprog
    ```

    (The `console` flag tells `dotnet` that the program will run from
    the command line, instead of providing a windowed graphical user
    interface.)

    To compile the program, there is no need to write a `Makefile`.
    Just type

    ```
    $ dotnet run
    ```

    within the `myprog` directory, and the program will be compiled
    and executed automatically.

-   The standard library provided by C\# is very complete, and several
    other libraries can be easily downloaded from the Internet using
    the `dotnet` command. (This is particularly handy for this course,
    as you will be asked to employ external libraries to save images
    in PNG/JPEG formats!)

-   There is very good IDE support: the best in the class is surely
    Rider
    ([www.jetbrains.com/rider/](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)),
    whose «Community edition» can be downloaded for free. Visual
    Studio Code
    ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) is a
    good second choice, although not as powerful.

-   The C\# language is widely used, and there are several online
    resources. The [Reference
    Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
    published by Microsoft is particularly good. A short and clear
    textbook is *C\# in a nutshell*, by Joseph and Ben Albahari
    (O'Reilly).

-   Microsoft has recently released the [.NET6
    platform](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), which is easy to install
    and shows impressive performance.

-   If you have the hobby of developing videogames, C\# is for you!
    The [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine))
    game engine is an industrial standard in videogame programming and
    uses C\# as its scripting language. [Several
    blockbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unity_games#2019)
    have been developed using it.


The experience of students using C\# for this course has been
extremely positive so far.


# D

The D language is the creation of [Walter
Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright), which authored
one of the most famous C++ compilers available in the '90: the Zortech
C++ compiler (later called the [Digital
Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Mars) C++ compiler).
Bright was dissatisfied with the direction taken by the C++ committee,
and he decided to develop a new language that was based on C but did
not strive to maintain compatibility with it (unlike C++). The result
is a more «modern» and elegant language, which however has not reached
the same level of adoption as C++.

Unlike C++, D does not uses header files, as these are notoriously
error-prone; rather, it use *modules*, which work similarly to Python:

```d
import std.stdio;
import std.format;
import std.array;
import std.algorithm.searching;
import std.math;
import std.random;
import std.datetime.stopwatch;
```

Constants can be defined exactly like in C++:

```d
const double DEFAULT_TMIN = 1e-10;
const double DEFAULT_TMAX = 1e+10;
```

Things get interesting when you define a new `struct` or `class`:

```d
struct Vec {
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;

  // This is a template over the type W
  void toString(W)(ref W writer, scope const ref FormatSpec!char f) const
       if (isOutputRange!(W, char)) // Template constraint
         {
           put(writer, "<");
           formatValue(writer, x, f);
           put(writer, ", ");
           formatValue(writer, y, f);
           put(writer, ", ");
           formatValue(writer, z, f);
           put(writer, ">");
         }

  // Another template
  double opBinary(string op)(const ref Vec other) const
       if(op == "*") {
         return x * other.x + y * other.y + z * other.z;
       }

  Vec opBinary(string op)(double t) const
       if(op == "*") {
         return Vec(t * x, t * y, t * z);
       }

  // Here we use a "mixin": a string that is interpreted at compile
  // time and substituted as a line of code. The "~" operator
  // concatenates strings.
  Vec opBinary(string op)(const ref Vec other) const
       if (op == "+" || op == "-") {
         return mixin("Vec(x " ~ op ~ " other.x, " ~
                      "y " ~ op ~ " other.y, " ~
                      "z " ~ op ~ " other.z)");
       }
}
```

The syntax `struct Vec...` is clearly derived from C++, but templates
use a different syntax: instead of writing

```c++
template<typename W>
void toString(W & writer, const FormatSpec<char> & f) const
```

in D you write this

```d
void toString(W)(ref W writer, scope const ref FormatSpec!char f) const
```

When you *declare* a template, you put the template names within
parentheses, like `(W)`, but when you *use* an existing template, you
put the template parameters after the `!` character. When we will
explain the theory of compilers at the end of the course, we will
learn why the D syntax is much more convenient to parse, but at the
moment you should just accept this difference.

Operator overloading works differently from C++, because it does not
force you to re-define several operators that all look alike:

```c++
// This is the same C++ code we saw before
[[nodiscard]] constexpr Vec operator+(const Vec &a, const Vec &b) noexcept {
  return Vec(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y, a.z + b.z);
}

// This is almost the same as operator+: boring!
[[nodiscard]] constexpr Vec operator-(const Vec &a, const Vec &b) noexcept {
  return Vec(a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y, a.z - b.z);
}
```

In D, binary operators like $+$ and $-$ are overloaded by the same
template function `opBinary(string op)`; in C++, this would probably
look like the following:

```c++
template<std:string op>
constexpr Vec opBinary(const Vec &a, const Vec &b)
```

If C++ worked like D, the C++ compiler would translate `a + b` into
`opBinary<"+">(a, b)` (still using the C++ syntax) instead of the
usual `operator+(a, b)`. The approach followed by D reveals its
strengths when used with *mixins*, which is a way to tell the compiler
to generate source code using string interpolation functions:

```d
Vec opBinary(string op)(const ref Vec other) const
     if (op == "+" || op == "-") {
       return mixin("Vec(x " ~ op ~ " other.x, " ~
                    "y " ~ op ~ " other.y, " ~
                    "z " ~ op ~ " other.z)");
     }
```

The strange-looking `if` placed *before* the braces (`{}`, which is
something not admitted in C++) is a *template constraint*: it tells
that the template should not be applied for *any* string passed to
`op`, but only if the string is either `"+"` or `"-"`. The `~`
operator means string concatenation (this is unlike C++, where you
concatenate `std::string` objects using `+`), and the code

```d
mixin("Vec(x " ~ op ~ " other.x, " ~
      "y " ~ op ~ " other.y, " ~
      "z " ~ op ~ " other.z)");
```

tells the compiler to do the following steps:

1.  Calculate the concatenation of the strings; if `op == "+"`, the
    result is

    ```d
    "Vec(x + other.x, y + other.y, z + other.z)"
    ```

2.  Put the string as if it were a true line of code at the spot where
    the `mixin` was used; again, if `op == "+"` then the result is

    ```d
    Vec opBinary(string op)(const ref Vec other) const
         if (op == "+" || op == "-") { // We assume now that op == "+"
           return Vec(x + other.x, y + other.y, z + other.z);
         }
    ```

    but of course this is done in the same way if `op == "-"`.

This combination of `opBinary` and mixins is extremely useful for the
purpose of this course, as we will need to define a number of
unary/binary operations on data types. Doing this in C++ is quite
boring, but in D the task is much simplified.

The definition of `Sphere`, `Ray`, and `intersect` should be trivial
to follow:

```d
struct Ray {
  Vec origin;
  Vec dir;
  double tmin;
  double tmax;

  // Constructors in D are named as "this"; in C++ this should
  // have been
  //
  //     Ray(Vec or, Vec d…)
  //
  this(Vec or, Vec d, double tmin = DEFAULT_TMIN, double tmax = DEFAULT_TMAX) {
    this.origin = or;
    this.dir = d;
    this.tmin = tmin;
    this.tmax = tmax;
  }
}

struct Sphere {
  Vec center;
  double radius;
}

bool intersect(ref Sphere sphere, ref Ray ray) {
  const Vec op = sphere.center - ray.origin;
  const double dop = ray.dir * op;
  const double D = dop * dop - op * op + sphere.radius * sphere.radius;

  if (0 > D) {
    return false;
  }

  const double sqrtD = sqrt(D);

  const double tmin = dop - sqrtD;
  if (ray.tmin < tmin && tmin < ray.tmax) {
    return true;
  }

  const double tmax = dop + sqrtD;
  if (ray.tmin < tmax && tmax < ray.tmin) {
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

Here are a few advantages of D:

-   If you know C++, most of the syntax of D will look familiar.

-   The ability to manipulate the code using templates and mixins is
    more powerful than C++ and at the same time easier to grasp than
    C++ templates.

-   There are *three* good D compilers:

    1.  The DMD compiler is the first D compiler, released by Walter
        Bright and regularly maintained. It compiles code quickly and
        has a nice command-line interface, but it produces slow
        executables, so it is only good for debugging.

    2.  The GCC compiler supports D through the command-line program
        `gdc` (which you should probably install separately, as by
        default GCC only installs support for C and C++). Since the
        code generator is the same as `g++`, the speed of executables
        written in D and compiled with `gdc` is the same as C++
        programs compiled with `g++` (which means that they run very
        fast!).

    3.  Finally, the LDC compiler is based on LLVM and thus uses the
        same technology as the Clang compiler (the default C++
        compiler on Mac OS X) and the Rust compiler (see below).

-   D uses a sane approach for floating-point computation, as it sets
    uninitialized floating-point variables to `NaN`: this eases
    debugging, as it is immediately clear if you forgot to initialize
    a `double`!

-   There is good support for editors; Visual Studio Code should be
    your first choice (although I prefer writing D programs in
    Emacs…).

-   There is no need to use a `Makefile`, as D uses a package/build
    manager named `dub`.

There are a few disadvantages too:

-   The amount of on-line resources is far more scarce than for C++.

-   The language has evolved a lot in the last years, and it is still
    evolving. Many pages in the documentation refers to old practices
    and conventions, and you should probably refer to the [D language
    forum](https://forum.dlang.org/) to learn if there is some better
    way to implement what you have in mind. (Unfortunately, the D
    community itself is often not sure about what language features
    are the best ones to use depending on the problem. This has been a
    cause of confusion for students!)
    
-   Last year, my own students have stumbled upon bugs in the D compiler
    itself, which refused to compile perfectly valid code.
    
-   A quite important library needed for the course, `std.stream`,
    [has been
    deprecated](https://forum.dlang.org/thread/qpilvmprtyqxmyladkdq@forum.dlang.org),
    but no alternative still exist to cope with this deficiency. In
    past years, students using D had to develop their own stream
    routines or force the compiler to use the deprecated library
    (which is however risky!).

A few good resources to learn D:

-   *Programming in D: tutorial and reference*, by Ali Çereli, is
    [available online](https://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html). It is
    a comprehensive book that teaches *everything* about D.

-   *The D programming language*, by Andrei Alexandrescu (2010,
    Addison-Wesley), is unfortunately dated, as D evolved a lot in the
    last ten years. Still, this is by far one of the best programming
    book not only for the D language but in general: Alexandrescu is a
    gifted writer, and the book is full of intriguing examples.
    Despite its age, it is a real gem.

D could be the perfect language for this course, because it's
significantly better than C++ and easier to use. However, the
scattered and sometimes contradictory documentation can be a barrier
for students willing to use it.


# Free Pascal

Pascal is one of the most venerable languages listed in this document.
It was developed by prof. Niklaus Wirth in 1970, but it raised to
widespread use only when in the 1980s Borland International produced
and commercialized the Turbo Pascal[^borlandtp] compiler. Wirth
developed the Pascal language as a tool to teach programming to
students, which means that the language is meant to be easy to learn
and teaches good programming practices. It was used to develop
Apple Mac OS[^macos] at least until version 6 (after that, Pascal
fell out of fashion and Apple slowly rewrote parts of it in C).

[^borlandtp]: It is interesting to note that one of the lead
    developers of the Turbo Pascal compiler was Anders Hejlsberg, the
    creator of C\#.

[^macos]: If you are curious, you can test how Mac OS looked like in
    your browser by going to <https://macos9.app/>.

Today one of the most used Pascal compilers is FreePascal
([freepascal.org](https://freepascal.org/)), which implements several
new features in addition to the basic Pascal language proposed by
Wirth.

Unlike C++, Pascal uses verbose keywords in place of symbols: for
instance, instead of writing `{` and `}`, Pascal requires `begin` and
`end`, and instead of `&&` and `||` it uses `and` and `or`.

To define new data types, you must start with the `type` keyword; a
C++ `struct` corresponds to a `record` in Pascal. Here is the
implementation of the `Vec` class:

```pascal
uses strutils;   (* This imports the "Format" function *)

type
   Vec = record
      x, y, z: Real;
   end;

function FormatVec(const v : Vec) : String;
begin
   result := Format('<%.2f, %.2f, %.2f>', [v.x, v.y, v.z]);
end;

operator * (t : Real; const v : Vec) : Vec; inline;
begin
   result.x := t * v.x;
   result.y := t * v.y;
   result.z := t * v.z;
end;

operator * (const a, b : Vec) : Real; inline;
begin
   result := a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z;
end;

operator * (a : Real; const v : Vec) : Real; inline;
begin
   result.x := a * v.x;
   result.y := a * v.y;
   result.z := a * v.z;
end;
```

Unlike C++, Pascal uses the `:=` operator to mark an assignment;
because of its didactic nature, Wirth wanted a language that marked
the difference in roles between the left and right sides of
expressions like `a := b` (where `a` gets modified but not `b`).

Other notable differences with respect to C++ are the following:

-   Instead of `{` and `}`, Pascal uses `begin` and `end`.

-   In C++, function parameters are declared with the form
    `type name`, e.g., `int a`. In Pascal, the type comes *after* the
    name: `name: type`.

A peculiarity of Pascal is that the language is case-insensitive: you
can either write `BEGIN`, `begin`, `Begin`, and the compiler will
accept any of these. (This can be a feature to prevent sloppy students
from defining variables named `x` and `X` in the same function, as the
compiler will complain that the same variable is defined twice!)

The ability to define custom operators has been added by the
FreePascal compiler; the original Pascal language did not have this
feature.

The code to intersect rays and spheres is defined similarly:

```pascal
type
   Ray = record
      m_o : Vec;
      m_d : Vec;
      m_tmin : Real;
      m_tmax : Real;
   end;

   Sphere = record
      m_p : Vec;
      m_r : Real;
   end;

function intersect(sphere: Sphere; ray: Ray) : Boolean;
var
   op : Vec;
   dop : Real;
   D : Real;
   sqrtD : Real;
   tmin, tmax : Real;

begin
   op := sphere.m_p - ray.m_o;
   dop := ray.m_d * op;
   D := dop * dop - op * op + sphere.m_r * sphere.m_r;

   if 0 > D then
      Exit(False);

   sqrtD := sqrt(D);
   tmin := dop - sqrtD;
   if (ray.m_tmin < tmin) and (tmin < ray.m_tmax) then
      Exit(True);

   tmax := dop + sqrtD;
   result := (ray.m_tmin < tmax) and (tmax < ray.m_tmax);
end;
```

Unlike C++, Pascal requires to list the variables used in a function
in a `var` section before the `begin`, as shown in the function
`intersect`. The return value of a function can be either assigned to
the implicit variable `result` or returned through the `Exit`
procedure.

Here are a few advantages of FreePascal over C++:

-   Because of a precise design choice by Wirth, the Pascal language
    has been designed to be very quick to compile. In fact, it takes
    only a few seconds to compile very large codebases ($10^5$ lines
    of code and more), which is at least one order of magnitude less
    than modern C++ compilers.

-   No need to use header files: the declaration and the
    implementation of functions/classes is written in the same file.

-   No need to use a `Makefile` to compile the code, as FreePascal
    uses [units](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Unit), which let the
    compiler decide on its own when files need to be recompiled.

-   There is a very good IDE for FreePascal, Lazarus
    ([www.lazarus-ide.org](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)).

-   Lazarus (see above) provides a very intuitive way to develop
    graphical user applications. Although this is not required for the
    course, students can take advantage of buttons, windows and other
    visual elements to provide a more friendly interface to their
    program. See this example, showing a program developed with
    Lazarus that is rendering a coarse version of a 3D image using the
    techniques explained in this course:

    ![](pd-images/pathtracer-lazarus.png)

    The colored horizontal bar at the bottom indicates the percentage
    of image that has been computed so far, and the controls on the
    right allow the user to tune the input parameters used to render
    the image.

    Developing this kind of graphical user applications is usually
    very hard, but Lazarus makes this task straightforward. Have a
    look at the video [Lazarus Tutorial #4 - The first
    calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl4O5WGU-BQ) for a
    nice example.

There are a few disadvantages as well:

-   Pascal tends to be a little verbose, and it lacks some high-level
    constructs found in more recent languages.

-   The quality of the documentation available on the FreePascal site
    is not fantastic.
    
-   Although much faster than interpreted languages like Python and
    Ruby, FreePascal produces executables that are $\sim 10\,\%$
    slower than those produced by other compilers.

If you are interested in developing a graphical interface for the
program we will develop during this course, you should pick FreePascal
without hesitation, as **no other language** in this document enables
the same easiness in building a GUI.

A few references to learn FreePascal and Lazarus:

-   To see how easy it is to build graphical interfaces in Lazarus,
    you should watch the YouTube video [Lazarus Tutorial #4 - The
    first calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl4O5WGU-BQ) (it
    is the fourth part in a series, but it is the first one that shows
    how to use the GUI builder).

-   If you plan to use Lazarus to develop a graphical interface for
    your program, you probably want to consult books written for
    [Borland Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)),
    which was Lazarus' ancestor: Lazarus is still compatible with
    Delphi, and so many of the stuff in any old book is still
    relevant. A particularly good one is *Delphi developer's guide* by
    Xavier Pacheco and Steve Teixeira (Sams publishing, 1995). It is
    still available on the web (e.g., on the [Internet
    Archive](https://archive.org/details/Delphi_Developers_Guide_SAMS)),
    and most of what is explained there applies to Lazarus as well.


# FreeBasic

Together with Pascal, the BASIC language is one of the oldest
presented here, as its first implementation appeared in 1964. The name
BASIC stands for «Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code»,
which stresses the fact that it is a language conceived for
«beginners». In the 1980s, it was a very common way to interact with
personal computers; the personal computers built by Commodore (Vic-20,
C64, C128, etc.) and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum greeted the user with a
prompt where BASIC commands could be issued directly:

![](pd-images/c64-basic.png){width=67%}

In the 1980s and 90s, a widely used BASIC compiler was Microsoft BASIC
PDS, together with Microsoft QuickBASIC (the latter was a simplified
edition of BASIC PDS). Microsoft introduced a number of enhancements
to the original BASIC language, and it included BASIC compilers in its
own operating system, MS-DOS (an ancestor of Windows). The most
advanced of these bundled BASIC compilers, QBasic[^qbasic], was a
stripped clone of Microsoft's own QuickBasic, and the fact that it was
available on every computer running MS-DOS contributed to the
popularity of the language.

[^qbasic]: If you are curious, you can run a copy of QBasic within
    your web browser, thanks to the Internet Archive:
    [archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack](https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack).

Today there are several BASIC compilers; most of them implement a
modernized version of Microsoft's BASIC dialect, but unfortunately
there are several slight differences in the syntax and grammar. (This
is in contrast with C++ compilers like `g++` and `clang`, which
understand pretty much the same language.). The most notable are the
following:

-   FreeBasic ([www.freebasic.net](https://www.freebasic.net/)): an
    open-source implementation of the Microsoft BASIC dialect, with
    many enhancements. It can emit C code that can be compiled by GCC:
    in this mode of operation, it produces extremely fast executables.

-   QB64 ([www.qb64.org](https://www.qb64.org/portal/)): a modern
    clone of Microsoft QuickBASIC.

-   Xojo ([www.xojo.com](https://www.xojo.com/)): a commercial BASIC
    compiler.

-   PureBASIC ([www.purebasic.com](https://www.purebasic.com/)):
    another commercial BASIC compiler.

-   Visual Studio.NET: this is a language by Microsoft which produces
    managed executables fully equivalent to their C\# counterparts. It
    is a very nice language, which implements the same features as C\#
    using a BASIC syntax and is supported by the `dotnet` executable
    discussed in the part about C\#. It would have been a great choice
    for this course, but unfortunately Microsoft has recently
    discontinued its support, as the number of users has declined over
    the last years. (Apparently, they all migrated to C\#.)

If you plan to use BASIC for this course, you are suggested to use
FreeBasic, and in any case you must avoid commercial compilers, as the
teacher must have a way to recompile your code to test it.

Here is an example showing how to implement a `Vec` data structure
similar to the one implemented in C++; the code assumes you are using
FreeBASIC:

```monobasic
type Vec
    as double x, y, z

    ' This converts a Vec into a printable string
    declare operator cast() as string
end type

operator Vec.cast() as string
    return "<" + str(x) + ", " + str(y) + ", " + str(z) + ">"
end operator

' Dot product
operator*(byval v1 as Vec, byval v2 as Vec) as double
    return v1.x * v2.x + v1.y * v2.y + v1.z * v2.z
end operator

' Scalar-vector product
operator*(t as double, byval v as Vec) as Vec
    return type<Vec>(t * v.x, t * v.y, t * v.z)
end operator
```

As this example shows, the syntax of the BASIC language is very
lightweight:

-   there are no `;` at the end of
    each line, because each line must contain one statement;

-   there is no need to use the curly braces `{}`, as defining a new
    operator already starts its definition, which continues up to the
    next `end`; each `end` is marked with a keyword (e.g., `end type`,
    `end operator`) to improve clarity.

-   BASIC is a case-insensitive language, so it is ok to write
    `END OPERATOR`, `end operator` (like above), or `End Operator` (as
    it is often the case in textbooks). This is a good thing, as it
    prevents you from using `X` and `x` to name two different
    variables, as it would be possible—but discouraged!—in C++.

Here is the implementation of the `ray` and `sphere` types, as well as
the code to check the intersection between a ray and a sphere:

```monobasic
type ray
    as Vec m_o
    as Vec m_d
    as double m_tmin
    as double m_tmax
end type

type sphere
    as Vec m_p
    as double m_r
end type

function intersect(byval s as sphere, byval r as ray) as boolean
    dim op as Vec = s.m_p - r.m_o
    dim dop as double = r.m_d * op
    dim d as double = dop * dop - op * op + s.m_r * s.m_r

    if 0.0 > d then return false

    dim sqrtd as double = sqr(d)
    dim tmin as double = dop - sqrtd
    if (r.m_tmin < tmin) and (tmin < r.m_tmax) then return true

    dim tmax as double = dop + sqrtd
    return (r.m_tmin < tmax) and (tmax < r.m_tmax)
end function
```

In FreeBASIC, variables are declared using the keyword `dim` (which
originally stood for `dimension`, because in the old Microsoft BASIC
it was used primarily to initialize arrays). Like C++ but unlike
Pascal, variables can be defined everywhere in the code.

FreeBASIC has several advantages over C++:

-   Despite the fact that implements many advanced features like
    classes, polymorphism, operator overloading, etc., it uses an
    extremely clean syntax, with no `;`, `{}`, etc. It is indeed
    refreshing to program in FreeBASIC after having been exposed to
    C++!

-   The language is well documented. In particular, there is one page
    that shows the correspondence between C++ constructs and FreeBASIC
    constructs:
    [www.freebasic.net/wiki/TblComparisonC](https://www.freebasic.net/wiki/TblComparisonC).

-   The language is quite safe, as every variable is automatically
    initialized to zero. Not initializing variables is a very common
    bug in C++, as the following example shows:

    ```c++
    double sum(const std::vector<double> &list) {
        double sum;  // Oh no, I forgot to initialize this variable!

        for(auto elem : list) {
            sum += list;
        }

        return sum;
    }
    ```

    These bugs are impossible in FreeBASIC.

-   The compiler is extremely fast.

-   The standard library provides the possibility to open a window and
    directly draw in it, using the commands `screen`, `pset`, etc.
    This can be used to provide a real-time preview of the images
    rendered by the code that you will develop for this course, which
    is extremely handy. The following is an example:

    ![](pd-images/freebasic-rendering.png){width=67%}

FreeBASIC has a few disadvantages too:

-   There is no real IDE for the language: you are forced to use a
    plain editor. (I use Emacs and
    [`freebasic-mode`](https://github.com/z80lives/freebasic-mode);
    probably there are other good alternative available on the web.)
    This means that you'll lack more advanced features like variable
    renaming, code browsing, refactoring tools, etc.

-   There are only a few online resources to learn the language.
    However, as said above, the documentation of the FreeBASIC
    compiler is quite good
    ([www.freebasic.net/wiki/DocToc](https://www.freebasic.net/wiki/DocToc)).

-   It is not easy to download and install new libraries, as the
    language lacks a package manager. (This shortcoming is shared with
    C++.)

-   Mac OS X is not supported officially, although [people
    report](https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32191)
    that it can be possible to make it run on Apple hardware


# Julia

Julia is a modern language for scientific computing. It is heavily
inspired by the Scheme language, a LISP dialect that introduced
several interesting programming paradigms like hygienic macros and
functional patterns.

Julia's main purpose is to provide a highly performant language for
scientific applications, and as a consequence has stellar support for
mathematical operations. Although the language is very easy to learn,
it is not straightforward to develop *fast* code, as the execution
model is significantly different from any other language listed in
this document.

To see how Julia helps in writing scientific code, here is the
implementation of the vector data structure:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra
using StaticArrays

const Vec = SVector{3,Float64}
```

There is no need to define any operator for `Vec` class, as Julia has
native support for vector operations: addition, dot product and
scalar-product multiplication are already available.

The following code implements the `Ray` and `Sphere` data structures,
as well as the `intersect` method:

```julia
struct Ray
    o::Vec
    d::Vec
    tmin::Float64
    tmax::Float64

    # We provide three constructors using overloading
    Ray(o, d, tmin, tmax) = new(o, d, tmin, tmax)
    Ray(o, d, tmin) = new(o, d, tmin, DEFAULT_TMAX)
    Ray(o, d) = new(o, d, DEFAULT_TMIN, DEFAULT_TMAX)
end

struct Sphere
    r::Float64
    p::Vec
end

function intersect(s::Sphere, ray::Ray)
    op = s.p - ray.o
    dop = ray.d • op
    d = dop^2 - op • op + s.r^2

    0.0 > d && return false

    sqrtD = √d

    tmin = dop - sqrtD
    
    # The «Julia way» to write "if … then return true"
    (ray.tmin < tmin < ray.tmax) && return true

    tmax = dop + sqrtD
    ray.tmin < tmax < ray.tmax
end
```

Even if you do not understand the mathematics used in the `intersect`
method, the sequence of mathematical operations should be clear. The
dot operator `•` is provided by the `LinearAlgebra` package, which was
loaded before defining the `Vec` class. A few other niceties of the
language are the following:

-   There is no need to close a statement with `;` because they end at
    the end of a line;

-   There are no curly braces `{}`, you just write `end` when
    appropriate;

-   Julia implements the ternary operator `a < x < b`, which
    corresponds to the longer form `(a < x) && (x < b)` in C++;

-   Several mathematical operators can be used as functions or
    mathematical operators: for instance, you can either write `√d` or
    `sqrt(d)`, and `ray.d • op` or `dot(ray.d, op)`;

-   There is no need to write `return` on the last statement of a
    function.

The most important advantages of Julia are the following:

-   It matches the same speed as C++;

-   Julia's syntax is clear and nice to read, much similar to
    FreeBASIC;

-   Mathematical codes like the ones to be developed for this course
    are easy to write in Julia, thanks to its friendly mathematical
    notation;

-   It has a rock-solid package manager, which can be used to easily
    install packages from the Internet.

However, Julia has a few disadvantages:

-   It must be used as an interpreter: although possible, it is not
    trivial to produce a standalone executable. This will require
    students using Julia for this course to quickly learn how to adapt
    the way the code is described during the classes to the way Julia
    works: Julia code is usually not executed from the command line as
    it is the case in C++. Past students often found counterintuitive
    to do this.

-   It uses *multiple dispatch* instead of traditional OOP constructs.
    Although in my opinion multiple dispatch is superior to OOP,
    developing Julia code requires a change in mindset if one comes
    from OOP languages like C++.

-   Sometimes it is not immediate to understand why some Julia code is
    slow; one needs to fully understand Julia's execution model to
    take full advantage of its capabilities.

-   Apart from the [official
    documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), a **great**
    book to learn Julia is [Hands-On Design Patterns and Best
    Practices with
    Julia](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-julia/9781838648817),
    by Tom Kwong. It describes with many practical examples how to
    properly use Julia, and what are the best strategies to optimize
    code for maximum performance. Manning is going to publish a new
    book about Julia, [Julia as a second
    language](https://www.manning.com/books/julia-as-a-second-language)
    by Erik Engheim, which is another great introduction to the
    language; although it is not completed yet, you can already buy a
    draft copy for a discounted price and receive the full copy once
    it will be finished. (Disclaimer: I'm the technical reviewer of
    this book.)
    
    There is also some good material on YouTube: [A Gentle
    Introduction to
    Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4igzy3bGVkQ) (syntax) and
    [Getting Started with Julia (for Experienced
    Programmers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lJK92bEKow)
    (development environment) are two examples.

In the past, the satisfaction of students who picked Julia was quite
high, but some of them lamented that it required substantial effort to
«un-learn» how to do some tasks in C++ and to understand the different
approach required by Julia.


# Kotlin

Kotlin is a relatively new language, as its first version was released
in 2011. It is a *managed* language like C\#, but it is based on the
Java Virtual Machine; so, many of the things discussed for C\# apply
to Kotlin as well.

Kotlin is being used more and more since Google added full support for
Kotlin[^immuni] in the Android operating system (previously only Java
was fully supported, with partial support for C, C++, and Go). If you
are interested in mobile programming, it might be worth picking this
language.

[^immuni]: In Italy, one of the most famous apps available on the
    Google Store is the *Immuni* app. It has been written in Kotlin,
    and the source code is available online:
    [github.com/immuni-app/immuni-app-android](https://github.com/immuni-app/immuni-app-android)

Kotlin was developed by JetBrains, a Russian company that offers
several advanced IDEs like CLion (C++ and Rust), PyCharm (Python),
IntelliJ IDEA (Java/Kotlin), etc. For this reason, JetBrains provides
an IDE with stellar support for Kotlin through IntelliJ IDEA. If you
pick Kotlin, you should install IDEA and do not look for anything
else.

Here is a possible implementation for the `Vec` class, which
implements a 3D vector:

```kotlin
data class Vec(val x: Double, val y: Double, val z: Double) {
    override fun toString(): String {
        return "<$x, $y, $z>"
    }

    operator fun times(other: Vec): Double {
        return x * other.x + y * other.y + z * other.z
    }

    operator fun times(t: Double): Vec {
        return Vec(t * x, t * y, t * z)
    }
}
```

Kotlin's syntax is clearly inspired by C++, but it avoids using `;`.
However, unlike C++, the variable members are listed *before* the
curly braces: similarly to Pascal but unlike C++, types are specified
after parameter names.

Here is the implementation of the `Ray` and `Sphere` classes:

```kotlin
import kotlin.math.sqrt

data class Ray(val m_o: Vec,
               val m_d: Vec,
               val m_tmin: Double = 1e-10,
               val m_tmax: Double = 1e+10)

data class Sphere(val m_r: Double, val m_p: Vec) {
    fun intersect(ray: Ray) : Boolean {
        val op = m_p - ray.m_o
        val dop = ray.m_d * op
        val D = dop * dop - op * op + m_r * m_r

        if (0 > D) {
            return false
        }

        val sqrtD = sqrt(D)
        val tmin = dop - sqrtD
        if (ray.m_tmin < tmin && tmin < ray.m_tmax) {
            return true
        }

        val tmax = dop + sqrtD
        return (ray.m_tmin < tmax && tmax < ray.m_tmax)
    }
}
```

A few advantages of Kotlin are the following:

-   If you are interested in learning a modern language that can be
    used to develop mobile applications for Android devices, Kotlin is
    probably the best option.

-   Kotlin is pedagogically useful, as it implements a very neat way
    to implement[^null] *null safety* through nullable values. These
    are used when you request the value for a variable from some
    source which might be unavailable or erroneous (e.g., a missing
    file, or a badly typed user input.)

-   There are several libraries available to Kotlin programs, as you
    can easily import and use Java libraries.

[^null]: The term *null safety* refers to the ability of a language or
    a program to properly handle missing values.

Disadvantages of Kotlin:

-   Although the syntax looks clean, it is not as straightforward as
    C\# or FreeBASIC.

-   You will probably need to learn a new build system, as Makefiles
    do not work well with the Java Virtual Machine. (However, if you
    use IntelliJ IDEA you can manage this task from within a graphical
    user interface.)

-   You are forced to use the Java Virtual Machine (JVM); this might
    be considered an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on the
    case. On one hand, the JVM makes impossible segmentation faults (a
    virtue of managed languages!). However, you might need to tune the
    Java Virtual Machine to obtain good performance. (This is partly
    true for C\# as well, but the problem seems to be more relevant
    for the JVM.)

-   It happens quite often that Kotlin's documentation refers to Java,
    and thus you are somewhat expected to get acquainted with this
    language too. This is due to the fact that Kotlin is heavily based
    on Java, much like C++ is based on C.

-   The students that have used Kotlin in the last year sometimes felt
    that tasks that other students found hard to implement were solved
    automatically and almost «magically» by the IDE, depriving them of
    the opportunity to better learn what was happening behind the
    scenes.

A few good resources to learn Kotlin:

-   The YouTube video [Kotlin Course - Tutorial for
    Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UC9DY-vIU) is
    probably the best video around that teaches (1) how to program in
    Kotlin and (2) how to use IntelliJ IDEA to write code in Kotlin.

-   A good book is [*The Joy of
    Kotlin*](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-kotlin), by
    Pierre-Yves Saumont (2019, Manning). Another book by Manning is
    [*Kotlin in
    action*](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action), by
    Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana Isakova (2017, Manning), but this one
    assumes you already know Java.


# Rust

The last language described in this document is Rust
([www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/)), which is probably
the most complex language you can pick for this course.

The first stable release of the language was published in 2010,
although Rust was already being used in several professional projects.
The development team was led by Graydon Hoare (Mozilla Foundation).

Rust is a language that looks similar to C++ (curly braces `{}`
everywhere!), yet it introduces a few new fundamental concepts:

-  Data ownership;
-  Borrowing model;
-  Lifetime tracking.

The concept of «data ownership» is implemented in C++ as well through
the classes `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, but Rust
implements it in a pervasive way, as it is deeply buried in the
fundamentals of the language, while in C++ it is a matter of two
classes in the standard library.

Grasping data ownership, borrowing rules and lifetimes can be
daunting; in fact, they are probably among the biggest difficulties in
learning the language; fortunately, there are several good resources
online that teach them. Unfortunately, you can't postpone learning
these concepts, as all of them are fundamental to write any
non-trivial codes. On the other side, Rust is being used more and
more, and it seems that several people in the field of physics are
interested in learning it. Moreover, it is a formidable pedagogical
tool to learn how values are represented in memory: learning Rust
makes you a better programmer, no matter if you abandon it and move to
other languages!

Because of its difficulty, I strongly suggest that only people that
have already written some non-trivial code in Rust pick it for this
course. It would be optimal if *at least three students* pick Rust, so
that if one of them gets frustrated and picks some other language, the
other two can keep using it.

The code we implemented so far is not a good example of the difficulty
of the language, as the `Vec3` type is a *value type* (allocated on
the stack and not on the heap). The code that implements the data type
`Vec3` thus looks deceivingly trivial:

```rust
use std::ops;

// The ability to print Vec3 variables is automatically enabled
// by "Debug"
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
struct Vec3 {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    z: f64,
}

// Dot product
impl ops::Mul<Vec3> for Vec3 {
    type Output = f64;

    fn mul(self, other: Vec3) -> f64 {
        self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y + self.z * other.z
    }
}

// Scalar-vector product
impl ops::Mul<f64> for Vec3 {
    type Output = Vec3;

    fn mul(self: Vec3, other: f64) -> Vec3 {
        Vec3 {
            x: other * self.x,
            y: other * self.y,
            z: other * self.z,
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the implementation of the `Ray` and `Sphere` data types, as
well as the ray/sphere intersection code. Again, the complexity of the
Rust memory model does not appear here because we are still using
value types:

```rust

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
struct Ray {
    m_o: Vec3,
    m_d: Vec3,
    m_tmin: f64,
    m_tmax: f64,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
struct Sphere {
    m_r: f64,
    m_p: Vec3,
}

fn intersect(sphere: Sphere, ray: Ray) -> bool {
    let op = sphere.m_p - ray.m_o;
    let dop = ray.m_d * op;
    let d = dop * dop - op * op + sphere.m_r * sphere.m_r;

    if 0.0 > d {
        return false;
    }

    let sqrtd = d.sqrt();
    let tmin = dop - sqrtd;
    if (ray.m_tmin < tmin) && (tmin < ray.m_tmax) {
        return true;
    }

    let tmax = dop + sqrtd;
    (ray.m_tmin < tmax) && (tmax < ray.m_tmax);
}
```

The code above does not show the mechanism of borrowing, nor data
ownership or lifetime, mainly because of the `Copy` and `Clone`
specifications, which elegantly avoid the issue in this particular
problem. However, this is **not going to be true** for many other data
structures that will be used in the course, so this example is a
oversimplification.

Here is a list of advantages for Rust:

-   It is pedagogically important to understand the concept of «data
    ownership», «borrowing», and «lifetimes». No other language listed
    in this document forces students to learn them *well*.

-   IDE support for Rust is excellent: [JetBrains
    CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) with the Rust plugin is
    perfect, and you should look nowhere else. [Visual Studio
    Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is quite good if you install
    a plugin that support the Language Server Protocol (LSP). However,
    even with the best plugin, Visual Studio Code is still not as good
    as CLion.

-   Despite its young age, there are several online resources to learn
    the language. (This is probably related to the fact that it has
    been awarded «best language of the year» several years in a row by
    [the StackOverflow
    site](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted).)

-   Programs written in Rust are very fast, usually on par with C++.

-   It is trivial to handle projects written in Rust using the `cargo`
    package manager, as there is no need to write a `Makefile` to
    trigger compilations. The following command creates a new folder
    `myproj` and initializes a «Hello world!» program in it:

    ```
    $ cargo new myproj
    ```

    To compile and run the program, run the following command within
    the `myproj` directory:

    ```
    $ cargo run
    ```

    If you use CLion, things are even simpler, as pressing `Shift+F10`
    automatically calls `cargo` and executes the program in a terminal
    window.

-   Like `dotnet` for C\#, `cargo` has the ability to download
    libraries and package from the web and install them automatically.

A few disadvantages of Rust are the following:

-   As I repeatedly stated above, Rust is a hard language to learn!

-   Its support for floating-point numbers favours correctness over
    easiness-of-use, but in some cases this «correctness» is more
    theoretical than real. This means that implementing a few
    algorithms required in the course will require more pain than for
    other languages, but the resulting code will not necessarily be
    more robust.
    
-   Handling errors (an important topic in this course) is really
    hard!

-   The compiler can be **extremely slow** in compiling programs.

A few good resources to learn Rust:

-   Two excellent books are [*The Rust programming
    language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) by Steve Klabnik and
    Carol Nichols (No starch press, 2019), and [*Rust in
    action*](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) by Timothy
    S. McNamara (Manning, 2021).

-   [Ryan Levick's YouTube
    Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpeX4D-ArTrsqvhLapAHprQ)
    has some very good videos about Rust. Alas, the editor used in the
    videos is Visual Studio Code and not CLion!
